            <h2 class="sub-header">It's a Marathon not a 5K</h2>
            <p>I had a lot of anxiety building this website. I placed a lot of internal pressure on myself to make this site great. Looking back on it I realize that it was unnecessary because your website is a reflection of who you are, and what you can do in that moment. Due to this you're always going to be changing and making things better. The quicker you come to peace with that idea, the easier it will be to produce content, and embrace the imperfections.<p>

            <h2 class="sub-header">Create a MVP</h2>
            <p>The first place you should start when creating a website is decide what is your message, and who your audience is. For me, I wanted a website that showcased my technical capabilites and writing skills. Secondly, decide what type of pages your site will have. Then sketch out a very simple design for each page. This way as you start to build out your website you will have a visual reference.</p>

            <h2 class="sub-header">You Don't Need a Domain to have a Site</h2>
            <p>It's very easy to feel like oh well I don't have a personal domain so I can't build my own website. That's simply untrue. Especially during the MVP phase of your site it's perfectly ok to utilize github pages or some other similar site. The most important part is getting your site fleshed out. Later on if you want to buy your own personal domain you can.</p>

            <h2 class="sub-header">Rome wasn't built in a day</h2>
            <p>It's easy to feel like you have to make everything perfect before you share your site with others. One way to get around this is to place a coming soon sign on your unfinshed pages. If your concerned about how it will look you can pick out a nice picture to act as a background image, and then place fancy text over it.</p>

            <h2 class="sub-header">Use this as a Learning Opportunity</h2>
            <p>If you're a aspiring web developer like me building your own website is a perfect opportunity to get more practice writing code. So use this opportunity to experiment with different languages or frameworks you want to learn. For me I wanted to get some practice with bootstrap.</p>

            <p>Now that you have a handy guide to get started, go forth and merry coding.</p>
