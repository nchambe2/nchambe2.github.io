    <!--How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

        I originally thought that wireframing the HTML page with a pair would be extremely difficult. I didn't know what tools we would use to sketch out our design, or how long it would even take for us to agree on a design. However, it went really smoothly. We divided the work between one person narrating the inital design, and the other person using illustrator to sketch it out.Once we had the design sketched out creating the HTML page was pretty quick.

        Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

        I did find wireframing to be extremely helpful, especially when pairing. I think the wireframe forced us to step back, and open up a dialogue about what our blog page would look like. From there creating the HTML page was super easy because we just referenced the wireframe for guidance.

        What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

        For us a good wireframe was not about creating a picture perfect rendering of how our blog would look. Instead, we used our wireframe to capture just the structure of our blog post.

        What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

        I learned about the <section> and <header> tag. I've seen these tags before, but really didn't understand how they should be used.

        Both section and header are tags that were added in HTML5.

        The section tag is similar to the div tag. However, it provides more semantic meaning and is used to group similiar content together.

        The header tag is used to  groups navigational and introductory content together.
