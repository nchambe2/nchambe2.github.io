**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**
  I learned that all elements are surrounded by a invisible box. That invisible box is made up of the  content, the padding which directly surronds the content, the border which surrounds the padding, and finally the margin. It's important to understand the box model concept because it plays a major factor in spacing. While understanding border property was pretty straight-forward. The thing I had the most problem with was the difference between padding and space. After watching a code school video I realized that margins is for placing spacing between two elements. While padding is about increasing the space around the content area without affecting the size of the content.

**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**
  I learned about the different types of CSS positioning:
    - Static: The normal behavior of all elements are static. The only reason to ever apply a static position to a element is if some other styling has inadvertently affected it's position.
    - Relative: Relative changes an element's position from where it originally was to where you want it to go. If you declare position: relative but don't specify top, right, bottom, left the position of the element will not change. If you do specify any of the other positions it will move the element relative to where it originally was positioned.
    - Fixed: It's placed relative to the browser. So the element stays in place when scrolling occurs.
    - Absolute: Allows you to place a page element relative to the nearest parent element that has relative or absolute positioning. If there isn't a parent element with those type of positioning then it will be based on the positioning of the html tag.
    - Sticky: Keeps element positioned in a certain place so when scrolling it remains stuck to a certain place.

**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**
  Implementing color and font-size was super easy to implement. I didn't really run into any troubles with it. The most difficult thing was positioning. I really struggled with getting the footer to stick to the bottom of the page. It just wouldn't for some reason.

**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**
  I realized that I need to get a deeper understanding of positioning, responsive design, and using percentages. While I can define what each CSS position does, I struggle to use them approporiately.  I feel like I really don't have a grasp on it yet, so I will be spending some extra time on it.
