**Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.**

You can liken creating a repository on GitHub to creating a project folder on Google drive. First, you navigate to GitHub, fill out a form with some information about your project folder such as it the project name, project description, whether the project folder contents should be public or private, a README which provides information about the project, and a open source license if you plan to give rights to others to share and view your project.

Like Google Drive you now have a project folder that you can interact with via Google Drive's websites. However, the project is not saved locally onto your machine. In order to save the project folder locally you would have to download it.

A similar thing has to happen if you want to interact locally with your project folder from GitHub. However, instead of downloading the folder you clone it onto your machine. Once you finish cloning the project folder you can now view the contents, add new contents, and edit exisiting contents.

**Describe what open source means.**

Free and Open Soure Software allows people to publically share their source code on GitHub with others. In the hopes that people outside of the original designated contributors will make changes to the codebase.

**What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?**

I think Open Source projects are a great idea. Essentially, it empowers a community to work on code together. This is especially great for projects that will bring a lot of benefit to people, but there isn't a budge for someone to pay others to work on it.

Open Source doens't make me nervous or protective becasue GitHub gives you a lot of power in who can see your repo, and the terms and conditions they must adhere to in order to make changes to your codebase.

**Assess the importance of using licenses.**

If you don't use a license then by default your code can't be shared and worked on by others.
If you want to have your codebase  shared and worked on by others, it's a good idea to include a license so that way people are clear on the terms and conditions under which they can work on your codebase.

**What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?**

I got better at creating pull requests. The first two times I did it I had to re-watch the video and read the instructions. This time around I didn't have to use the instructions, but there were times that I made changes, pushed those changes up, but didn't see the branch appear on the main GitHub page. Nevertheless, I was still able to merge the changes.
